 * Created by gerard on 12-01-2016.

 * {@link java.time} snippet from
 * concepts, including:
 *    * instants: a numeric timestamp retrieved from a Clock for logging and persistence of a point in time,
 *    * durations: storage of periods and durations of time.
 *    * dates, times, time-zones and periods.
 *
 * Java Time is based on the ISO calendar system with Gregorian Rules
 * All the classes are immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * Date printing and parsing is supported by each class See {@link java.time.format}
