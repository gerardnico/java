package Java.Generic.Literal;

// https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/literals.html
// the class java.lang.Class is generic
// Since the newInstance() method in Class now returns a T,
// you can get more precise types when creating objects reflectively.

// Example:
// For example, suppose you need to write a utility method that performs a database query, given as a string of SQL, and returns a collection of objects in the database that match that query.
